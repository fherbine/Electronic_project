## Electronic project from 42 school.
During 7 months we had to make a connected compass from scrath.

 - It began in February after we passed a test to be able to register to the Electronic project at school.


 - First we had to write specifications about our project during a month: including user manual, the description of our project and a first Bill of Material. You can access to these specifications [here](https://github.com/fherbine/Electronic_project/blob/master/vomnes_IBoussole_Cahier_des_Charges.pdf).


 - Then we had to make a proof of concept, from march to June. This step has shown our capability to build a final prototype for our project.

- Finally we built our prototype !
