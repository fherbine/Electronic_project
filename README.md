Electronic project from 42 school. During 7 months we had to make a connected compass from scrath.

It began in February after we passed a test to be able to register to the Electronic project at school.

First we had to write specifications about our project, including user manual, the description of our project and a first Bill of Material. You can access to these specifications [here](https://github.com/fherbine/Electronic_project/blob/master/vomnes_IBoussole_Cahier_des_Charges.pdf).

Then we have to make a proof of concept, this step has shown our capability to build a final prototype for our project.
